# IT-Service-Request-Power-App

# Introduction
The IT Service Request Power App streamlines how employees submit and track IT-related issues while giving IT staff the tools they need to manage, prioritize, and resolve requests efficiently. Designed with clarity and usability in mind, it ensures every request — from initial submission to resolution — is transparent, trackable, and easy to follow.

# Key Features
1) Personalized Dashboard
  i) New users see a welcoming screen with “No Requests” until they submit their first request.

  ii) Once submitted, requests appear instantly with key details such as ID, Status, Department, Issue, Remarks, and Created Date.
  
  iii) Real-time counters show the number of requests in each status category (New, In Progress, On Hold, Completed), automatically updating as IT staff work on them.
  
2) Smart Filtering & Sorting
  i) Users can quickly narrow down their view using dropdown filters such as Status, Issue, Department, Priority, Assigned, and Location.

  ii) Sort options (“Old to New” or “New to Old”) help users review older tickets or focus on the most recent issues.
  
  iii) Regular employees see a simplified set of filters, while IT staff have access to more advanced options to support tracking and coordination.
  
3) Tailored Experience for IT Staff
  i) IT personnel can create service requests on behalf of employees, with key fields auto-filled to ensure data consistency.

  ii) Additional controls allow IT staff to assign requests, update statuses, and manage priorities with ease.
  
  iii) The system defaults to showing the most recent and most urgent requests first, enabling faster response times.
  
4) Guided Submission & Validation
  i) Built-in validation prevents incomplete or unclear requests.

  ii) Employees are guided through a structured form with dropdowns for issues and locations, remarks fields, and optional attachments.
  
  iii) Upon submission, both the employee and the IT administrator receive an automatic email confirmation with all request details.
  
5) Detailed Request View & History
  i) Each request includes a full record of its lifecycle, including comments, updates, status changes, and assigned personnel.

  ii) Employees can view a chronological “Comment History” showing all IT actions taken.
  
  iii) IT staff have an “Update” function to log actions, assign colleagues, and adjust priorities.
  
6) Reopen & Accountability Features
  i) Completed requests can be reopened by IT staff if issues resurface, requiring a reason before proceeding.

  ii) The system tracks reopen events with timestamps and uses color-coded indicators to show which requests have been reopened and whether they were later completed.
  
  iii) This creates a transparent record of recurring issues and ensures accountability at every stage.
  
7) Download & Reporting
  i) A built-in download option generates an Excel file with all visible requests, including full comment histories.

  ii) The file is automatically emailed to the requester for offline analysis, reporting, or auditing.
